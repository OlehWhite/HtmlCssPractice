        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.[4] His early
            schooling was suspended in 1967 as a result of the Nigerian Civil
            War. At 13 years, he served in the Biafran army. After the war he
            completed high-school equivalence through self-study. <br />
            He is married to Dale Brown Emeagwali, a noted African-American
            microbiologist.[5]
        </p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship
            following completion of a correspondence course at the University of
            London. He received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Oregon
            State University in 1977. He later moved to Washington DC, receiving
            in 1986 a master's degree from George Washington University in ocean
            and marine engineering, and a second master's in applied mathematics
            from the University of Maryland. Next magazine suggested that
            Emeagwali claimed to have further degrees.[6][7] During this time,
            he worked as a civil engineer at the Bureau of Land Reclamation in
            Wyoming.
        </p>
        <h2>Court case and the denial of degree</h2>
        <p>
            Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan
            from 1987 through 1991. His thesis was not accepted by a committee
            of internal and external examiners and thus he was not awarded the
            degree. Emeagwali filed a court challenge, stating that the decision
            was a violation of his civil rights and that the university had
            discriminated against him in several ways because of his race. The
            court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan
            state Court of Appeals.[8]
        </p>
        <h2>Supercomputing</h2>
        <p>
            Emeagwali received the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for an application of
            the CM-2 massively-parallel computer. The application used
            computational fluid dynamics for oil-reservoir modeling. He received
            a prize in "price/performance" category, with a performance figure
            of about 400 Mflops/$1M.[15] The winner in the "performance"
            category, was also the winner of the Price/performance category, but
            unable to receive two prizes. Mobil Research and Thinking Machines,
            used the CM-2 for seismic data processing and achieved the higher
            ratio of 500 Mflops/$1M. The judges decided on one award per entry.
            [3][2] His method involved each microprocessor communicating with
            six neighbors.[10]
        </p>
        <p>
            Emeagwali's simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time
            approach to reservoir modeling.[1]
